      "question": "What is a CSS unit and why is it important?",
      "answer": "A CSS unit defines the measurement for property values like length, size, or spacing. Units are important because they determine how large or small elements appear across different devices and resolutions.",
      "explanation": "Choosing the right unit affects the scalability, responsiveness, and consistency of your web layouts."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-002",
      "question": "List and briefly describe three absolute units in CSS.",
      "answer": "1. `px` (pixels): A fixed, device-dependent unit.  \n2. `cm` (centimeters), `mm` (millimeters), `in` (inches): Physical length units, mostly used for print.  \n3. `pt` (points), `pc` (picas): Typically used in print stylesheets.",
      "explanation": "Absolute units are best for print or when precise sizing is required, but are less flexible for responsive design."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-003",
      "question": "What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?",
      "answer": "`em` is relative to the font-size of the element’s parent, while `rem` is relative to the font-size of the root (`html`) element.",
      "explanation": "`rem` ensures consistent scaling across components, whereas `em` allows for nested scaling effects."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-004",
      "question": "How do viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) work?",
      "answer": "`vw` is 1% of the viewport's width, and `vh` is 1% of the viewport's height. For example, `50vw` is half the viewport width.",
      "explanation": "Viewport units are commonly used for responsive layouts, such as full-page sections or hero banners."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-005",
      "question": "What does the `%` unit represent in CSS?",
      "answer": "The `%` unit is relative to the parent element’s size or another related property. For example, `width: 50%` makes the element half as wide as its parent.",
      "explanation": "Percentages are great for fluid, responsive designs."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-006",
      "question": "What are `ch` and `ex` units and when would you use them?",
      "answer": "`ch` is the width of the '0' (zero) character in the element’s font. `ex` is the height of the lowercase 'x' in the font. Use them for typographic layouts, such as setting the width of input fields or aligning text.",
      "explanation": "They are useful when you want sizing to relate to the current font’s characters, making content more readable."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-007",
      "question": "How does CSS handle mixing different units in a single property value?",
      "answer": "You can mix units using the `calc()` function. Example: `width: calc(100% - 30px);` combines percentage and pixel units.",
      "explanation": "`calc()` is powerful for creating dynamic layouts that require flexibility between fixed and relative measurements."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-008",
      "question": "Why are relative units often preferred over absolute units for web design?",
      "answer": "Relative units like `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vw`, and `vh` allow layouts to adapt to different screen sizes and user settings, improving accessibility and responsiveness.",
      "explanation": "Using relative units ensures content is readable and usable across devices."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-009",
      "question": "What happens if you omit the unit for a property that requires one (e.g., `width: 10;`)?",
      "answer": "The declaration is invalid and ignored by the browser.",
      "explanation": "Always include the correct unit (e.g., `px`, `%`, etc.) for properties that require them to ensure styles are applied."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-19-010",
      "question": "Can you use decimals with CSS units? Give an example.",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use decimals (e.g., `font-size: 1.5em;` or `margin: 0.25rem;`).",
      "explanation": "Decimals allow for fine-tuned adjustments in sizing and spacing."
