      "question": "What are the four main components of the CSS box model?",
      "answer": "The four main components are: Content, Padding, Border, and Margin. Content is the innermost part containing text or images. Padding surrounds the content. Border wraps the padding. Margin is the outermost space between the border and other elements.",
      "explanation": "Understanding the box model is essential for controlling spacing and layout of elements."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-002",
      "question": "How does `box-sizing: border-box;` affect the box model?",
      "answer": "`box-sizing: border-box;` makes the element's width and height include its padding and border, not just the content. This simplifies sizing elements.",
      "explanation": "It prevents elements from becoming larger than expected when padding or borders are added."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-003",
      "question": "What is the difference between `content-box` and `border-box` values of `box-sizing`?",
      "answer": "`content-box` (default) means width/height apply only to content, so padding and border are added outside. `border-box` makes width/height include content, padding, and border.",
      "explanation": "`border-box` makes layouts easier to manage, while `content-box` can lead to unexpected sizing."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-004",
      "question": "How can you create extra space inside an element, between its content and border?",
      "answer": "Use the `padding` property. For example, `padding: 10px;` adds 10px of space inside the border around the content.",
      "explanation": "Padding increases the space inside the box, helping with readability and layout."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-005",
      "question": "How can you add space outside an element, separating it from other elements?",
      "answer": "Use the `margin` property. For example, `margin: 20px;` adds 20px of space outside the border.",
      "explanation": "Margins create spacing between elements, helping with layout and alignment."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-006",
      "question": "If a box has `width: 200px; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid; margin: 5px;`, what is its total rendered width (with default `box-sizing`)?",
      "answer": "The total width is 200px (content) + 10px*2 (padding left/right) + 2px*2 (border left/right) = 224px. Margin adds space outside, so total space including margin is 224px + 5px*2 = 234px.",
      "explanation": "With `box-sizing: content-box`, padding and border are added to width. Margin is always outside."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-007",
      "question": "Does margin affect the size of an element’s box?",
      "answer": "No, margin does not affect the size of the element’s box. It only affects the spacing outside the box.",
      "explanation": "Margins create separation between elements, but do not change the element’s actual width or height."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-008",
      "question": "What happens if you set `overflow: hidden;` on a box with content that is bigger than the box?",
      "answer": "Any content that exceeds the box's boundaries will be clipped and hidden from view.",
      "explanation": "This is useful for containing floating elements or preventing scrollbars."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-009",
      "question": "How can you visually debug the box model in the browser?",
      "answer": "Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect elements. The computed styles panel shows the box model with content, padding, border, and margin.",
      "explanation": "This helps identify layout bugs and understand how styles are applied."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-14-010",
      "question": "How do inline and block elements differ in terms of the box model?",
      "answer": "Block elements respect width, height, margin, and padding on all sides. Inline elements ignore width/height, only apply horizontal padding/margin, and do not start on a new line.",
      "explanation": "Understanding this distinction helps with layout and spacing decisions."
