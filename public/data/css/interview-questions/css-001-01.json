      "question": "What is CSS and why is it used in web development?",
      "answer": "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media, allowing you to separate content from design.",
      "explanation": "CSS is crucial for web development as it enables developers to control the look and feel of web pages, leading to better user experiences and easier maintenance."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-002",
      "question": "How does CSS relate to HTML?",
      "answer": "CSS and HTML are complementary: HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS controls its layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. CSS can be embedded in HTML files or linked from external files.",
      "explanation": "Using CSS with HTML promotes separation of concerns, making code easier to manage and update."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-003",
      "question": "What does 'Cascading' mean in CSS?",
      "answer": "'Cascading' refers to the way CSS applies rules based on specificity, inheritance, and source order. If multiple rules match an element, CSS determines which one to apply using the cascade algorithm.",
      "explanation": "The cascade allows developers to write flexible, layered styles and resolve conflicts predictably."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-004",
      "question": "List three ways to apply CSS to an HTML document.",
      "answer": "1. Inline styles (using the style attribute on elements)\n2. Internal styles (using a <style> block in the HTML head)\n3. External styles (linking a .css file with <link> in the HTML head)",
      "explanation": "Each method suits different scenarios. External is preferred for maintainability."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-005",
      "question": "What is the main advantage of using an external CSS file?",
      "answer": "External CSS files allow you to write styles in a single location and apply them to multiple web pages, making site-wide updates easy and promoting code reuse.",
      "explanation": "This reduces duplication and helps maintain consistency across a website."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-006",
      "question": "Describe the basic structure of a CSS rule.",
      "answer": "A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block: `selector { property: value; }`. The selector targets the HTML element(s), and the declaration block defines one or more property-value pairs.",
      "explanation": "Understanding this structure is foundational to writing and reading CSS."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-007",
      "question": "What is a selector in CSS?",
      "answer": "A selector is a pattern used to select the HTML elements you want to style. Examples include element selectors (`p`), class selectors (`.class`), and id selectors (`#id`).",
      "explanation": "Selectors control which elements a CSS rule affects."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-008",
      "question": "How does CSS improve website accessibility?",
      "answer": "CSS enables better color contrast, font resizing, and layout adjustments, all of which help make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.",
      "explanation": "Accessibility is a key aspect of modern web design, and CSS provides tools to support it."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-009",
      "question": "Can you write CSS without HTML? Why or why not?",
      "answer": "CSS alone has no effect without HTML (or XML) because it needs elements to style. CSS must be used in conjunction with markup languages.",
      "explanation": "CSS is a presentation language, not a markup or programming language."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-010",
      "question": "What is browser default styling and how does CSS interact with it?",
      "answer": "Browsers apply default styles (user agent stylesheets) to HTML elements. CSS overrides these defaults, allowing developers to customize the appearance as needed.",
      "explanation": "Understanding defaults is important for effective CSS resets and custom styling."
