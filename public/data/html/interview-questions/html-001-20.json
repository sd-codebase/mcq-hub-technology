      "id": "interview-001-20-002",
      "question": "How do you make a web page responsive using HTML and CSS?",
      "answer": "Use a combination of flexible layouts (percentages, auto), media queries, and responsive units (em, rem, vw, vh) in CSS.",
      "explanation": "Media queries allow you to apply different styles at different screen widths. Example:\n```css\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  body { font-size: 16px; }\n}\n```"

      "question": "What is the viewport meta tag and why is it crucial for mobile responsiveness?",
      "answer": "The viewport meta tag controls the layout viewport's size and scale. Example:\n```html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n```",

      "answer": "Set images to use relative (percentage) widths or use CSS max-width:\n```css\nimg { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }\n```",
      "explanation": "This makes images shrink within their parent container on smaller screens."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-20-005",

    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-20-010",
      "question": "Why should you avoid using fixed widths in responsive web design?",
