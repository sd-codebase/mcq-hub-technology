      "question": "What is semantic HTML and why is it important?",
      "answer": "Semantic HTML uses elements that convey meaning about the structure and content of a web page, such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`, instead of non-semantic tags like `<div>` or `<span>`.",
      "explanation": "Semantic tags improve accessibility, SEO, and code readability by making the page's structure clear to browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-002",
      "question": "List five semantic HTML elements and describe their typical use.",
      "answer": "- `<header>`: Represents introductory content or navigation links.\n- `<nav>`: Contains the main navigation links of a page.\n- `<main>`: Contains the dominant content unique to the document.\n- `<article>`: Contains self-contained content that could be distributed independently.\n- `<footer>`: Contains information about the author, copyright, or related links at the end of a section.",
      "explanation": "These elements describe their content's role, making the page easier to understand for both humans and machines."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-003",
      "question": "How does semantic HTML improve accessibility?",
      "answer": "Semantic HTML provides cues to screen readers and assistive technologies about the structure and purpose of content, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand the page.",
      "explanation": "For example, using `<nav>` lets screen readers identify navigation areas, and `<main>` indicates where the main content is."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-004",
      "question": "What is the difference between `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<div>`?",
      "answer": "- `<section>` groups related content, typically with a heading.\n- `<article>` contains independent, self-contained content.\n- `<div>` is a generic container with no semantic meaning.",
      "explanation": "Use `<section>` and `<article>` for meaningful grouping; use `<div>` only when no semantic element fits."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-005",
      "question": "When should you use `<aside>` in your HTML?",
      "answer": "Use `<aside>` for content tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.",
      "explanation": "This helps browsers and assistive technologies identify secondary content."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-006",
      "question": "How does semantic HTML benefit search engine optimization (SEO)?",
      "answer": "Semantic elements help search engines understand the meaning and hierarchy of the content, improving how pages are indexed and ranked.",
      "explanation": "For example, search engines give more weight to text in `<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` tags."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-007",
      "question": "How can you use semantic tags to improve code maintainability?",
      "answer": "Semantic tags make the HTML structure clearer, so developers can easily understand the purpose of each section and update the code efficiently.",
      "explanation": "Clear structure reduces bugs and makes collaboration easier."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-008",
      "question": "What would be the semantic replacement for a `<div id=\"navigation\">` element?",
      "answer": "Replace it with a `<nav>` element:\n\n```html\n<nav>\n  <!-- navigation links -->\n</nav>\n```",
      "explanation": "This change adds meaning for browsers, search engines, and assistive tech."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-009",
      "question": "Can you nest semantic elements inside each other? Give an example.",
      "answer": "Yes, semantic elements can be nested. For example:\n\n```html\n<article>\n  <header>...</header>\n  <section>...</section>\n  <footer>...</footer>\n</article>\n```",
      "explanation": "Nesting reflects the logical structure of the content."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-13-010",
      "question": "Is it OK to use non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>`? When should you use them?",
      "answer": "Yes, use `<div>` and `<span>` when no suitable semantic element exists. They are useful for grouping or styling content that doesn't carry specific meaning.",
      "explanation": "Prefer semantic tags when possible, but use non-semantic ones when adding structure or styles without implying meaning."
