      "question": "What does the `<br>` tag do?",

    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-007",
      "question": "How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?",
      "answer": "Use the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute. Example: `<a href=\"https://example.com\">Link</a>`",

      "id": "interview-001-01-008",

    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-009",
      "question": "How do you create a list of items in HTML?",
      "answer": "Use `<ul>` for unordered (bulleted) lists and `<ol>` for ordered (numbered) lists. List items go inside `<li>` tags.",
      "explanation": "Example: `<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>` creates a bulleted list."
    },
    {
      "id": "interview-001-01-010",
      "question": "What are HTML entities and why are they used?",
      "answer": "HTML entities are special codes used to display reserved characters or symbols, such as `&lt;` for `<` or `&amp;` for `&`.",
      "explanation": "Entities prevent confusion between code and content, allowing you to display characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML."
