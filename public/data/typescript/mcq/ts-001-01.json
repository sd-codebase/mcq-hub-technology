      "question": "What is the correct way to declare a variable with string type annotation in TypeScript?",
      "options": [
        "let name: String = \"John\";",
        "let name: string = \"John\";",
        "let name = String(\"John\");",
        "string name = \"John\";"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In TypeScript, primitive types are lowercase. The correct syntax is `let name: string = \"John\";`. `String` (uppercase) refers to the JavaScript String object wrapper, which is different from the primitive type."

      "id": "mcq-001-01-002",
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a valid number type value in TypeScript?",
      "options": ["42", "3.14", "NaN", "\"123\""],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "\"123\" is a string, not a number. In TypeScript, the number type includes integers, floating-point numbers, Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN, but not string representations of numbers."

      "id": "mcq-001-01-003",
      "question": "What will be the inferred type of the variable `let flag = true;`?",
      "options": ["any", "Boolean", "boolean", "true"],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "TypeScript will infer the type as `boolean` (lowercase) when you initialize a variable with a boolean value. The primitive boolean type is always lowercase in TypeScript."

    {
      "id": "mcq-001-01-004",
      "question": "What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in TypeScript?",
      "options": [
        "They are exactly the same",
        "null means 'no value', undefined means 'not yet assigned'",
        "null is a number, undefined is a string",
        "There is no difference in strict mode"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "`null` represents an intentional absence of value, while `undefined` typically means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value. They are distinct types in TypeScript."

    {
      "id": "mcq-001-01-005",
      "question": "Which statement is true about the `null` type in TypeScript?",
      "options": [
        "null is assignable to all types by default",
        "null is only assignable to object types",
        "null has its own type and is only assignable when strictNullChecks is false",
        "null is not a valid TypeScript type"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "In TypeScript, `null` has its own type. When `strictNullChecks` is enabled, `null` is only assignable to `null` and `any` types. When disabled, it's assignable to all types."

      "options": ["any", "number", "42", "Number"],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The variable `value` is explicitly annotated with the type `number`. This is the primitive number type in TypeScript (lowercase)."

        "let name: string || null;",
        "let name: string, null;"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The union type syntax using the pipe symbol `|` is correct: `string | null`. This allows the variable to hold either a string value or null."

      "id": "mcq-001-01-008",
      "question": "What will TypeScript infer as the type of: `let x;`?",
      "options": ["undefined", "null", "any", "unknown"],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "When a variable is declared without initialization and without a type annotation, TypeScript infers its type as `any`, allowing it to hold any value."

        "bool | null",
        "true | false | null"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct union type is `boolean | null`, which allows the variable to be true, false, or null. The boolean primitive type (lowercase) is used in TypeScript."

      "question": "What is the result of `typeof null` in TypeScript?",
      "options": ["\"null\"", "\"undefined\"", "\"object\"", "\"NULL\""],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Due to a historical JavaScript quirk that TypeScript inherits, `typeof null` returns \"object\". This is a well-known JavaScript behavior that remains for backward compatibility."
    },
    {
      "id": "mcq-001-01-011",
      "question": "Which of these is the correct way to declare a variable that must be a number and cannot be null or undefined?",

        "let age: number = null;",
        "let age!: number;",
        "let age: number = 0;"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "With `strictNullChecks` enabled, `let age: number = 0;` ensures the variable is initialized with a number value. Option 0 declares but doesn't initialize, which could be undefined. Option 3 initializes with a proper number value."

    {
      "id": "mcq-001-01-012",
      "question": "What happens when you try to assign undefined to a variable typed as string with strictNullChecks enabled?",
      "options": [
        "It compiles successfully",
        "It causes a compilation error",
        "It converts undefined to an empty string",
        "It causes a runtime error"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "With `strictNullChecks` enabled, TypeScript will throw a compilation error because `undefined` is not assignable to type `string`. You would need to use `string | undefined` to allow undefined."

        "let isActive: boolean = true;",
        "let isActive: bool = true;",
        "var isActive = Boolean(true);"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct TypeScript syntax is `let isActive: boolean = true;`. The type annotation uses lowercase `boolean`, and it follows TypeScript's variable declaration syntax."

      "id": "mcq-001-01-014",
      "question": "What is the type of a variable declared as: `let data: string | number | boolean;`?",
      "options": ["any", "Union type", "Intersection type", "Tuple type"],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a **union type**, indicated by the pipe `|` symbol. The variable can hold a value that is either a string, number, or boolean."

      "question": "Which value is NOT valid for a variable of type `number` in TypeScript?",
      "options": ["Infinity", "-Infinity", "NaN", "null"],
      "correct_answer": 3,
      "explanation": "With `strictNullChecks` enabled, `null` is not assignable to type `number`. However, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` are all valid number values in TypeScript."

    {
      "id": "mcq-001-01-016",

        "value can be any type",
        "value can only be null",
        "value can be null or undefined",
        "This is invalid syntax"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "`let value: null;` means the variable can **only** hold the value `null`. This is a very restrictive type annotation that's rarely used in practice."

        "let name: void;",
        "let name: null;"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax is `let name: undefined;`, though this would only allow the value `undefined`. More commonly, you'd use `string | undefined` to allow both string and undefined values."

      "id": "mcq-001-01-018",
      "question": "What is true about primitive types in TypeScript?",
      "options": [
        "They should be written in uppercase (String, Number, Boolean)",
        "They should be written in lowercase (string, number, boolean)",
        "Uppercase and lowercase are interchangeable",
        "TypeScript doesn't distinguish between them"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In TypeScript, primitive types should always be lowercase: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`. Uppercase versions refer to JavaScript object wrapper types and should generally be avoided."

        "let count: number & undefined;",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The union type syntax `number | undefined` is correct. This allows the variable to hold either a number value or undefined. The pipe `|` operator is used for union types."

      "options": ["null", "undefined", "0", "\"\" (empty string)"],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In JavaScript and TypeScript, a variable that is declared but not initialized has the value `undefined`. This is the default value for uninitialized variables."
